# Ethical Hacking

This repository serves as a **central knowledge base and workspace** for my ethical hacking journey. It contains projects, labs, notes, experiments, and practical implementations related to offensive and defensive security.

The repository is intentionally kept broad and flexible so it can grow over time as I continue learning, practising, and applying ethical hacking concepts in structured, legal, and educational environments.

## 📘 About This Repository

Ethical Hacking is the practice of **legally and ethically testing systems to identify security weaknesses**, understand attacker behaviour, and improve overall security posture.

This repository reflects that mindset by:

* Exploring both **defensive and offensive security concepts**
* Emphasising **realistic system setups** rather than isolated exploits
* Documenting learning through hands-on implementation

It acts as:

* A **personal learning archive**
* A **living portfolio of cybersecurity work**
